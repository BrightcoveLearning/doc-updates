Time for the monthly capitalization thing again. So I need to know approximately what percent of your time you spent on the following during this month. We have a new list for 2023. If you don't know what something is, ask me (though I don't know what a couple of them are either), though that probably means you haven't worked on it...

Self Service/Ease of Use
Beacon Video Cloud V3
Studio v2 
Ad Monetization & Insights
Comparative Analytics
Internal Comms Video Portal (MVP)

Total should be 70% or less. You can respond here or send me an email, whichever is easier. Doesn't have to be exact - just your best guess.

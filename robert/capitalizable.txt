Time for the monthly capitalization thing again. So I need to know approximately what percent of your time you spent on the following during this month. We have a new list for 2023. If you don't know what something is, ask me, though that probably means you haven't worked on it...

Self Service/Ease of Use
Beacon Video Cloud V3
Studio v2 
Ad Monetization & Insights
Comparative Analytics
Internal Comms Video Portal (MVP)
Data Services Platform (DSP)
Cloud Playout for FAST
Brightcove Interactivity
Audience Insights Project
VCPE - SkyMX Search Enhancements
VCPE - Roles and Permissions Phase 1
VCPE - Manifest API
Video Intelligence Project
QoE/QoS
New 3rd Party Connectors
2023 Integrations

Total should be 70% or less. You can respond here or send me an email, whichever is easier. Doesn't have to be exact - just your best guess.

Time for the monthly capitalization thing again. So I need to know approximately what percent of your time you spent on the following during June:
Beacon
CorpTV
Virtual Events
Studio redesign/marketing studio
Live DRM
Live scalability and low latency
Audience Insights
Hapyak
Total should be 70% or less. You can respond here or send me an email, whichever is easier. Doesn't have to be exact - just your best guess.
